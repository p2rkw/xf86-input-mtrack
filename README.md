xf86-input-mtrack
=================
###### v0.5.0

An Xorg driver for multitouch trackpads. Supports any trackpad whose kernel
driver uses the slotted multitouch protocol. For more information on the
protocol see the [kernel documentation][1].

This driver is compatible with Xorg server versions 1.7 to 1.19.0 It requires
the [mtdev][4] library to operate.

[xf86-input-multitouch][3] driver by Henrik Rydberg.


Building and Installing
-----------------------
This is a standard autoconf package. So:

    ./configure
    make && make install

It is likely that you will need to change system-dependent paths such as the
xorg module directory. Otherwise mtrack may be not installed in xserver search
path.
See `configure --help` for options.

To build deb package and install in system wide you will usually have to change
installation prefix to /usr like so:

    ./configure --prefix=/usr
    dpkg-buildpackage

Bug Reporting
-------------

If you found a bug, and you are going to submit it, first run

    xinput --list

then find your touchpad name/ID on the list and create report with output of

    xinput --list-props <your touchpad ID>

attached.

Configuration
-------------

The following is a minimal working InputClass section for xorg.conf:

    Section "InputClass"
        MatchIsTouchpad "on"
        Identifier      "Touchpads"
        Driver          "mtrack"
#       In case of problems enable/disable this line:
        MatchDevicePath "/dev/input/event*"
    EndSection

Configuration options may be defined inside the InputClass section to configure
the driver. See examples/ directory for example configuration files. Feel free to submit
yours, named as your laptop's model.
Available options and their defaults are as follows.

will be larger than other fingers. This is represented as a percentage of the
maximum touch value and is dependent on the trackpad hardware. Integer value.
Defaults to 25.

<a name="PalmSize"></a>
**PalmSize** - 
The minimum size of what's considered a palm. Palms are expected to be very
large on the trackpad. This is represented as a percentage of the maximum touch
value and is dependent on the trackpad hardware. Integer value. Defaults to 40.

<a name="ThumbRatio"></a>
**ThumbRatio** -
The width/length ratio of what's considered a thumb. It is expected that a
thumb is longer than it is wide. This tells the driver how much longer.
Percentage represented by an integer. Defaults to 70.

<a name="EdgeSize"></a>

ClickFinger1, ClickFinger2, or ClickFinger3. The driver will only add zones for
those ClickFinger values that are enabled. So setting ClickFinger1 to 0 and
enabling the other two will create two zones, one for ClickFinger2 and one for
ClickFinger3. Boolean value. Defaults to false.

Tips
-------------
##### Swipe to drag
To setup swipe to drag functionality you have to choose which swipe gesture (Scroll, Swipe, Swipe4)
will be used for dragging.
Example configuration for three finger drag:
```
    Option "SwipeDistance" "1"
    Option "SwipeLeftButton" "1"
    Option "SwipeRightButton" "1"
    Option "SwipeUpButton" "1"
    Option "SwipeDownButton" "1"
    Option "SwipeClickTime" "0"
    Option "SwipeSensitivity" "1000"
```
This will enable draging with three fingers. Change sensitivity for faster/slower movements.
Scroll, and Swipe4 are also supported.

##### Hold and move
Hold down one finger in place to initiate hold-and-move gesture.
Then move another finger to drag configured button.
Gesture will last as long as fist finger (a.k.a. stationary finger) will
be held down in place.

Increase TapMaxDist to give stationary finger more freedom.
Set Hold1Move1Button to 0 to disable, set to other value to send button other 
than "1".

##### Persistent dragging
If you're using lot of tools that require dragging you can make it a little bit
easier by enabling persistent tap-to-drag:
```
    Option "TapDragLockTimeout" "-1"
```
With that change you will have to perform additional tap when dragging with
tap-to-drag. Other positive values will let you continue yor drag within
specified time.

##### Enabling soft button
If you enable edge restriction an you still want the integrated button to click inside that edge, you must enable ClickFinger0.
```
    Option "ClickFinger0" "1"
```
You can also set another button instead of "1".

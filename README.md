xf86-input-mtrack
=================
###### v0.5.1

An Xorg driver for multitouch trackpads. Supports any trackpad whose kernel
driver uses the slotted multitouch protocol. For more information on the
protocol see the [kernel documentation][1].

This driver is compatible with Xorg server versions 1.7 to 1.19.0 It requires
the [mtdev][4] library to operate.

[xf86-input-multitouch][3] driver by Henrik Rydberg.


## Building and Installing
This is a standard autoconf package. So:
```
    ./configure
    make && make install
```
It is likely that you will need to change system-dependent paths such as the
xorg module directory. Otherwise mtrack may be not installed in xserver search
path.
See `configure --help` for options.

To build deb package and install in system wide you will usually have to change
installation prefix to /usr like so:
```
    ./configure --prefix=/usr
    dpkg-buildpackage
```
## Bug Reporting

If you found a bug, and you are going to submit it, first run
```
    xinput --list
```
then find your touchpad name/ID on the list and create report with output of
```
    xinput --list-props <your touchpad ID>
```
attached.

## Configuration


The following is a minimal working InputClass section for xorg.conf:
```
    Section "InputClass"
        MatchIsTouchpad "on"
        Identifier      "Touchpads"
        Driver          "mtrack"

#       In case of problems enable/disable this line:
        MatchDevicePath "/dev/input/event*"
    EndSection
```

### Options
Configuration options may be defined inside the InputClass section to configure
the driver. See examples/ directory for example configuration files. Feel free to submit
yours, named as your laptop's model.
Available options and their defaults are as follows.

---
#### Basic
**[TrackpadDisable](#TrackpadDisable)**<a name="TrackpadDisable"></a>
Disables trackpad touch input. A value of 0 will enable the trackpad. A value
of 1 will disable tapping and gestures but not movement. A value of 2 will
disable all input. A value of 3 will also disable physical buttons.  
Integer. Default is 0.

**[ButtonEnable](#ButtonEnable)**<a name="ButtonEnable"></a>
Whether or not to enable the physical buttons on or near the trackpad.  
Boolean value. Defaults to true.

**[ButtonIntegrated](#ButtonIntegrated)**<a name="ButtonIntegrated"></a>
Whether or not the physical buttons are integrated with the trackpad. If you
have a one-piece trackpad like on newer MacBooks, this should be set to true.
Button emulation depends on this value being correct.  
Boolean value. Defaults to true.

---
#### Responsiveness
**[Sensitivity](#Sensitivity)**<a name="Sensitivity"></a>
Adjusts the sensitivity (movement speed) of the touchpad. This is a real number
greater than or equal to zero. A value of 0 will disable pointer movement.

will be larger than other fingers. This is represented as a percentage of the
maximum touch value and is dependent on the trackpad hardware.  
Integer value. Defaults to 25.

**[PalmSize](#PalmSize)**<a name="PalmSize"></a>
The minimum size of what's considered a palm. Palms are expected to be very
large on the trackpad. This is represented as a percentage of the maximum touch
value and is dependent on the trackpad hardware.  
Integer value. Defaults to 40.

thumb is longer than it is wide. This tells the driver how much longer.  
Percentage represented by an integer.  
Integer value. Defaults to 70.

---
#### Zones<a name="Zones"></a>
Divide the touchpad into "zones". Clicking the integrated button in one of 
these zones will send the button event configured for ZoneButton1, ZoneButton2,
or ZoneButton3. The driver will only add zones for the ZoneButton values that
are enabled. The zone splitting start from the left using the smallest
ZoneButton# value. So enabling only ZoneButton2 and ZoneButton3 will create two
zones, the left one for ZoneButton2 and the right one for ZoneButton3.

Integer value. A value of 0 disables this zone split.  
Integer value. Defaults to 1.

**[ZoneButton2](#ZoneButton2)**<a name="ZoneButton2"></a>
The button to emulate when the zone is pressed. This will float to the right of
the leftmost zone. Integer value. A value of 0 disables this zone split.  
Integer value. Defaults to 2.

**[ZoneButton3](#ZoneButton3)**<a name="ZoneButton3"></a>
The button to emulate when the zone is pressed. This will float to the right of
the leftmost zone. Integer value. A value of 0 disables this zone split.  
Integer value. Defaults to 0.

**[LimitButtonZones](#LimitButtonZones)**<a name="LimitButtonZones"></a>
Restrict button zones inside the [EdgeBottom](#EdgeBottomSize) area. So instead of enabling zones
on the full pad height, the zone is limited to the percentage set for the [EdgeBottom](#EdgeBottomSize).  
Boolean value. Default to false.

Tips
-------------
#### Swipe to drag
To setup swipe to drag functionality you have to choose which swipe gesture ([Scroll](two-finger-scrolling), [Swipe](#three-finger-swipe), [Swipe4](#four-finger-swipe))
will be used for dragging.  
Example configuration for three finger drag:
```
    Option "SwipeDistance" "1"
    Option "SwipeLeftButton" "1"
    Option "SwipeRightButton" "1"
    Option "SwipeUpButton" "1"
    Option "SwipeDownButton" "1"
    Option "SwipeClickTime" "0"
    Option "SwipeSensitivity" "1000"
```
This will enable dragging with three fingers. Change [sensitivity](#SwipeSensitivity) for faster/slower movements.
Scroll, and Swipe4 are also supported.

#### Hold and move
Hold down one finger in place to initiate hold-and-move gesture.
Then move another finger to drag configured button.
Gesture will last as long as fist finger (a.k.a. stationary finger) will
be held down in place.

Increase [TapDragDist](#TapDragDist) to give stationary finger more freedom.
Set [Hold1Move1StationaryButton](#Hold1Move1StationaryButton) to 0 to disable, set to other value to send button other 
than "1".

#### Persistent dragging
If you're using lot of tools that require dragging you can make it a little bit
easier by enabling [persistent tap-to-drag](#TapDragLockTimeout):
```
    Option "TapDragLockTimeout" "-1"
```
With that change you will have to perform additional tap when dragging with
tap-to-drag. Other positive values will let you continue yor drag within
specified time.

#### Enabling soft button
##### Basic
If you like to keep a finger on the bottom of the pad to click and use another one to move the cursor, you should enable edge restriction and [ClickFinger0](#ClickFinger0) parameters.
```
    Option "EdgeBottomSize" "20"    # Disable tap and movement detection in the bottom 20% of the pad
    Option "ClickFinger0" "1"       # Enable clicking action "1" when no finger is detected
```
You could also use [ClickFinger0](#ClickFinger0) with [EdgeTop/Right/LeftSize](#EdgeDisabling).

##### Advanced
If you want more than one button in the bottom edge, you need to use a more  
advanced configuration. It will enable you use up to [3 buttons](#Zones) inside that [edge](#EdgeBottomSize).  
```
    Option "ButtonZonesEnable" "true"   # Enable "Zones"
    Option "LimitButtonZones" "true"    # Limit the zones to the bottom edge
    Option "EdgeBottomSize" "20"        # Disable tap and movement detection in the bottom 20% of the pad

    # Zones stack from left to right inside the 20% height defined above
    Option "ButtonZone1" "1"            # Left part fire click 1
    Option "ButtonZone2" "3"            # Middle part fire click 3
    Option "ButtonZone3" "2"            # Right part fire click 2
```

xf86-input-mtrack
=================
######v0.4.1

An Xorg driver for multitouch trackpads. Supports any trackpad whose kernel
driver uses the slotted multitouch protocol. For more information on the
protocol see the [kernel documentation][1].

This driver is compatible with Xorg server versions 1.7 to 1.19.0 It requires
the [mtdev][4] library to operate.

Building and Installing
-----------------------
This is a standard autoconf package. So:

    ./configure
    make && make install

It is likely that you will need to change system-dependent paths such as the
xorg module directory. Otherwise mtrack may be not installed in xserver search
path.
See `configure --help` for options.

To build deb package and install in system wide you will usually have to change
installation prefix to /usr like so:

    ./configure --prefix=/usr
    dpkg-buildpackage

Bug Reporting
-------------

If you found a bug, and you are going to submit it, first run

    xinput --list

then find your touchpad name/ID on the list and create report with output of

    xinput --list-props <your touchpad ID>

attached.

Configuration
-------------

The following is a minimal working InputClass section for xorg.conf:

    Section "InputClass"
        MatchIsTouchpad "on"
        Identifier      "Touchpads"
        Driver          "mtrack"
    EndSection
    
This configuration is similar to the 3 finger drag feature of OSX:
    
    Section "InputClass"
        MatchIsTouchpad "on"
        Identifier      "Touchpads"
        Driver          "mtrack"
        Option "SwipeDistance" "1"
        Option "SwipeLeftButton" "1"
        Option "SwipeRightButton" "1"
        Option "SwipeUpButton" "1"
        Option "SwipeDownButton" "1"
        Option "SwipeClickTime" "0"
        Option "SwipeSensitivity" "1000"
    EndSection

Configuration options may be defined inside the InputClass section to configure
the driver. See examples/ directory for example configuration files. Feel free to submit
yours, named as your laptop's model.
Available options and their defaults are as follows.

**TrackpadDisable** -
Disables trackpad touch input. A value of 0 will enable the trackpad. A value
of 1 will disable tapping and gestures but not movement. A value of 2 will
disable all input. A value of 3 will also disable physical buttons. Integer.
Default is 0.

**Sensitivity** - 
Adjusts the sensitivity (movement speed) of the touchpad. This is a real number
greater than or equal to zero. Default is 1. A value of 0 will disable pointer
movement.

**FingerHigh** - 
Defines the pressure at which a finger is detected as a touch. This is a
percentage represented as an integer. Default is 5.

**FingerLow** - 
Defines the pressure at which a finger is detected as a release. This is a
percentage represented as an integer. Default is 5.

**IgnoreThumb** - 
Whether or not to ignore touches that are determined to be thumbs. Boolean
value. Defaults to false.

**IgnorePalm** - 
Whether or not to ignore touches that are determined to be palms. Boolean
value. Defaults to false.

**DisableOnThumb** - 
Whether or not to disable the entire trackpad when a thumb is touching. Boolean
value. Defaults to false.

**DisableOnPalm** - 
Whether or not to disable the entire trackpad when a palm is touching. Boolean
value. Defaults to false.

**ThumbRatio** - 
The width/length ratio of what's considered a thumb. It is expected that a
thumb is longer than it is wide. This tells the driver how much longer.
Percentage represented by an integer. Defaults to 70.

**ThumbSize** - 
The minimum size of what's considered a thumb. It is expected that a thumb
will be larger than other fingers. This is represented as a percentage of the
maximum touch value and is dependent on the trackpad hardware. Integer value.
Defaults to 25.

**PalmSize** - 
The minimum size of what's considered a palm. Palms are expected to be very
large on the trackpad. This is represented as a percentage of the maximum touch
value and is dependent on the trackpad hardware. Integer value. Defaults to 40.

**EdgeSize** -
The size of an area around the trackpad where new touches are ignored (fingers
traveling into this area from above will still be tracked). This is represented
as a percentage of the total trackpad height. Defaults to 10.

**ButtonEnable** - 
Whether or not to enable the physical buttons on or near the trackpad. Boolean
value. Defaults to true.

**ButtonIntegrated** - 
Whether or not the physical buttons are integrated with the trackpad. If you
have a one-piece trackpad like on newer MacBooks, this should be set to true.
Button emulation depends on this value being correct. Boolean value. Defaults
to true.

**ButtonMoveEmulate**
Whether or not to count the moving finger when emulating button clicks.
Useful to disable if you use two hands on trackpad. Boolean value. Defaults to true.

**ButtonZonesEnable** -
Whether or not to enable button zones. If button zones are enabled then the
trackpad will be split into one, two, or three vertical zones. Clicking the
integrated button in one of these zones will send the button event for
ClickFinger1, ClickFinger2, or ClickFinger3. The driver will only add zones for
those ClickFinger values that are enabled. So setting ClickFinger1 to 0 and
enabling the other two will create two zones, one for ClickFinger2 and one for
ClickFinger3. Boolean value. Defaults to false.

**ButtonTouchExpire** -

value of 0 will not expire touches. Integer value. Defaults to 100.

click. Integer value. A value of 0 disabled one-touch emulation. Defaults to 2.

**ClickFinger3** - 
Which button to emulate when three fingers are touching the trackpad during a
click. Integer value. A value of 0 disabled one-touch emulation. Defaults to 0.

**TapButton1** - 
Which button to emulate for one-finger tapping. Integer value. A value of 0
disables one-finger tapping. Defaults to 1.

**TapButton2** - 
Which button to emulate for two-finger tapping. Integer value. A value of 0
disables two-finger tapping. Defaults to 3.

**TapButton3** - 
Which button to emulate for three-finger tapping. Integer value. A value of 0
disables three-finger tapping. Defaults to 2.

**TapButton4** - 
Which button to emulate for four-finger tapping. Integer value. A value of 0
disables three-finger tapping. Defaults to 0.

Tips
-------------
##### Swipe to drag
To setup swipe to drag functionality you have to choose which swipe gesture (Scroll, Swipe, Swipe4)
will be used for dragging.
Example configuration for three finger drag:
```
    Option "SwipeDistance" "1"
    Option "SwipeLeftButton" "1"
    Option "SwipeRightButton" "1"
    Option "SwipeUpButton" "1"
    Option "SwipeDownButton" "1"
    Option "SwipeClickTime" "0"
    Option "SwipeSensitivity" "1000"
```
This will enable draging with three fingers. Change sensitivity for faster/slower movements.
Scroll, and Swipe4 are also supported.

##### Hold and move
Hold down one finger in place to initiate hold-and-move gesture.
Then move another finger to drag configured button.
Gesture will last as long as fist finger (a.k.a. stationary finger) will
be held down in place.

Increase TapMaxDist to give stationary finger more freedom.
Set Hold1Move1Button to 0 to disable, set to other value to send button other 
than "1".

## Works pretty well on Ubuntu 18.04 with deepin DE & Xfce

########### 1. Install the mtrack driver ################
#cd /tmp
#git clone https://github.com/p2rkw/xf86-input-mtrack.git
#cd xf86-input-mtrack
#./configure --with-xorg-module-dir=/usr/lib/xorg/modules
#make
#sudo make install
########### 2. Copy this file to /usr/share/X11/xorg.conf.d/99-mtrack.conf ################
# precedence should be higher than synaptics and/or libinput (so not necessarily 99).


########### 3. I recommend using this together with dispad, to disable the touchpad while typing #############
## 1. install dependencies for dispad
#sudo apt install libconfuse-dev libxi-dev
#cd /tmp
#git clone https://github.com/BlueDragonX/dispad.git #installation will fail if you have autocrlf=true in your gitconf
#cd dispad
#./configure
#make
#sudo make install

## 2. launch dispad from terminal >dispad
## 3. configure config file >gedit ~/.dispad like so:
#	# default dispad config file

#	# name of the property used to enable/disable the trackpad
#	property = "Trackpad Disable Input"

#	# the value used to enable the trackpad
#	enable = 0

#	# the value used to disable the trackpad
#	disable = 3 

#	# whether or not modifier keys disable the trackpad
#	modifiers = false

#	# how long (in ms) to sleep between keyboard polls
#	poll = 44

#	# how long (in ms) to disable the trackpad after a keystroke
#	delay = 500

## 4. edit bashrc to launch dispad at terminal-startup
# echo -e "\n#Turn off touchpad upon keypress\ndispad\n" >> ~/.bashrc
# alternatively, you can start the daemon via putting this line in ~/.profile
# this profile option has the advantage of working straight from the beginning. However, it throws a warning (without consequences) after login.
